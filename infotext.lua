		Bullying is defined as:
			"An intentional behavior that hurts, harms, or humiliates a student, either physically or emotionally, and can happen while at school, in the community, or online. Those bullying often have more social or physical "power," while those targeted have difficulty stopping the behavior. The behavior is typically repeated, though it can be a one-time incident.
Students often describe bullying as when "someone makes you feel less about who you are as a person."¹
