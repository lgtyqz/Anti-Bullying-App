# Anti-Bullying-App


This is a mobile application to be implemented within school systems in order to help prevent, not only the effects, but the possibilty of students being bullied in thier school. Although this will not make a school a complete haven, it will however work to assist students in reporting bullying safely, quickly, and without the fear of being the so hated "snitch".

Overview of Application:

The goals in this app are stated simply in it's title. Making this app effective on the other hand will need help from administrators. In order to implement an app like this, staff (of some sort at the school), will need to sign up for responses from this application.

The main (planned) features of this app are:
- **Anonymous Reporting**: This enables users to report bullies without fearing retribution from bullies or other students.
- **In-app Communication**: This keeps private conversations private and enables long-distance communication with trusted adults.
- **Detailed Reporting**: So that all the necessary information is here in a short, easily readable format.
- **Information about Bullying**: So that students know both WHAT bullying is and HOW they can stop it.
